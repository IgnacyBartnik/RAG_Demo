# RAG Demo

A simple and clear demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system in Python.

## What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines information retrieval with generative AI models. It retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base and feeds it to a language model to generate more accurate and grounded responses.

## Features
- Loads a dataset of facts
- Embeds and stores them in a vector database
- Retrieves relevant chunks using vector search
- Reranks results with a cross-encoder for better accuracy
- Uses a local LLM to generate answers based on retrieved context

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repo and install requirements (see `requirements.txt`).
2. Run the notebook or script to see RAG in action.

## Portfolio & Live Demos
